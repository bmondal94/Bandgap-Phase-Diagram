<b>Me:</b> I want to grow this. Can grow this for me?<br>
<b><abbr title="Compositional Phase Diagram">CPD</abbr>:</b> Yeahhhhhhhhhh! Hmmmmmmmmmm!<br>
<b><abbr title="Bandgap Phase Diagram">BPD</abbr>:</b> Hey! Why do you wanna grow this?<br>
<b>Me:</b> I need a device like .... And I thoght this probably will work if I can grow this.<br>
<b>BPD:</b> Are you sure this will work as you want? <br>
<b>Me:</b> Nah! (after 2 days: Nope! It doesn't work. But we are going close. Let's try next one.) <br>
<b>BPD:</b> Wait. Don't waste your time and money. It seems to me this is not the right choice. Use here .... This will be the best option.<br>

<p>For the introduction to <b>bandgap phase diagram</b> (BPD) concept please refer to (work in progress). The main idea behind <abbr title="Bandgap Phase Diagram">BPD</abbr> is to understand the variation of the Direct-Indirect Transition (DIT) points with composition using the concept of band unfolding and Bloch spectral density, which ultimately give rise to DIT line/curve that as if, separates the nature of bandgap into two phases: direct and indirect. Please contact to the below contact addresses for further details. </p>
